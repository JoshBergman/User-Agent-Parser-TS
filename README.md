# User Agent Parser TS

By: Joshua Bergman

## Intended Use

The intended use of this program is to get the browser version and device type from a user agent string.

Built according to: [mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent)

## WARNING

Sniffing the user agent is not very reliable DO NOT use for anything important, and when used it should be a last resort.
